--people query without filters gives 19,112 player names
--attempt to use CTE to join player names from people to collegeplaying on playerid 
--then to schools on schoolid then to salaries on player id
WITH s1 AS (
SELECT DISTINCT p.playerid AS player, namefirst, namelast
FROM people AS p ),
--s2 gives 65 rows of Vandy players
s2 AS (
	SELECT schoolid, playerid AS player
FROM collegeplaying AS cp
WHERE schoolid LIKE 'vand%'),

s3 AS (
	SELECT playerid AS player, salary
FROM salaries AS s)

SELECT DISTINCT s1.player, s3.salary, schoolid
FROM s2
INNER JOIN s1

GROUP BY s1.player, s3.salary, schoolid
